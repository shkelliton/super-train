            <h2> HISTORY </h2> 
            <p>Finland was initially a province under Sweden, moving on later to become a Grand Duchy from the 12th to the 19th centuries. It ended up as a grand duchy of Russia after 1809 and gained complete independence in 1917. Finland is known for a thorough welfare system, equality, and a quality education system (CIA , 2021).</p>
            <p>In Finland’s history, there was a political instance called the Lapua Movement which extended from 1929 to 1932. Strong feelings of unrest grew from the Great Depression, leading a communist group from the parish of Lapua to gain popularity. This group pulled ideological influences from Italian Fascism and the hatred of Russian communism. The group intimidated and dominated the government, using methods of terror to control the state. The government did respond to the challenge and led the movement to its eventual collapse (Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia, 2021).</p>
