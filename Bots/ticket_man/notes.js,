LET ACTS AS A VARIABLE THING
//Can use either let or var, let is newer. Var is declared in a weird way
let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';


$ is getelementbyID - so ${name} would look for the variable name
Whereas ${'name'} would assume it is a string and say 'name' 
Backticks embed the expression inside ${...} into the string.
alert( `hello ${"name"}` ); // hello name

//NOTES + TO DO
// find height of wrapper, set image height same as wrapper
// scale for content
// make content height wrapperheight- headerheight
// figure out better name title color/method
// make home page 'About' page
// gallery function for artwork pages - multiple separate galleries for Sequential
// and character design?
// for pricing page, refer to image saved
// format like java with methods and that garbage

//IF POSSIBLE/IF TIME ALLOWS
//See if able to make website actually send an email for inquiries?
//see if you can change format based on device, is there a detect mobile function?
//maybe logo instead of actual name, put name in content area in its own div or something
//If I'm feeling adventurous, make a little animation around logo
//remove other navbar options on other pages
